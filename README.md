# AI-Powered Stock Trading Strategy

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-driven system to optimize stock trading decisions. The system employs machine learning and search algorithms to predict stock returns and identify the best trading opportunities.

## Features
Machine Learning Model: Uses a RandomForestRegressor to predict daily stock returns based on market data features such as open, high, low, close prices, volume, volatility, and momentum.

Search Algorithms: Incorporates A* search and Greedy search algorithms to evaluate potential trades, optimizing for return-to-risk ratio.

Data Integration: Fetches real-time and historical market data using the Alpha Vantage API.

Backtesting: Provides comprehensive backtesting to evaluate model performance against historical data.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

API: Alpha Vantage (for market data)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
